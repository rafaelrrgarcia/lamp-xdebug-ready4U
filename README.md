## XDebug

The XDebug library allows you to debug PHP in real time line by line.

For this, it is necessary to configure the environment and the IDE.

As I say before, it's possible to [configure XDebug in PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/configuring-xdebug.html#integrationWithProduct) easily. For Visual Studio Code, do the steps below:

1. Click at `Run and Debug`;
2. If no configuration, create it clicking at `Add configuration`
3. In the file `launch.json` paste the code below:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "XDebug on Docker",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 9001,
            "pathMappings": {
                "/var/www/html/": "${workspaceFolder}/www"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

To start debugging (independent of the IDE) do the following:

1. Install [Xdebug helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc) for Chrome / Edge / Opera;
2. Right click on the extension icon after installation and click on `Extension Options`
3. In IDE Key, choose PHPSTORM and click Save (there is no problem using other IDE's, the Key is the same)
4. Access the system and click on the extension icon. Choose Debug.
5. Now, in the IDE, just enter debug mode, include breakpoints in the code and update the system in the browser. The debugger will stop at the first breakpointed line found in the run.

Enjoy!

## EXTRA: Enable HTTPS

You can generate a self-signed certificate. The command below can be run on Linux.

**Important: Keep the key names as `readyf4u.desenv.key` and `readyf4u.desenv.crt` as these same names will be used in the Apache configuration.**

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ssl/readyf4u.desenv.key -out ssl/readyf4u.desenv.crt -subj "/C=BR/ST=SP/L=SP/O=Ready4U/CN=readyf4u.desenv"
```


The files must be generated in the root of the ssl folder of this project.

That's it. Just upload the containers and use them.

Since this is a self-signed certificate, the browser will display an error message, just go ahead and access the page.
